Intro :
Liz (Thora Birch) was born in a slum in the United States and began to suffer from the devastation of the family since she was a child, her parents were drinking and taking drugs, and her mother suffered from schizophrenia. Poor Liz needs to go out to beg, wander the corners of the city, and the misery of life seems endless.</description></item></channel></rss>
