Intro :

Liz (Thora Birch) was born in a slum in the United States and began to suffer from the devastation of the family since she was a child, her parents were drinking and taking drugs, and her mother suffered from schizophrenia. Poor Liz needs to go out to beg, wander the corners of the city, and the misery of life seems endless. As she grew up, Liz knew that only by reading books could she change her destiny and get out of the quagmire. She won a test paper from her teacher, completed the answer paper beautifully, and won the opportunity to read. From now on, Liz has embarked on a long journey to school. She tried her best to apply for a full scholarship to Harvard, and she didn't even have a decent dress for the interview. However, poverty did not stop Liz's determination to move forward, and in her life, the struggle that never flinched was an eternal theme.
