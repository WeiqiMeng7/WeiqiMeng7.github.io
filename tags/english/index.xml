1 Markdown.com.cn 简介 支持自定义样式的 Markdown 编辑器 支持微信公众号、知乎和稀土掘金 点击右上方对应图标，一键复制到各平台 2 Markdown语法教程 2.1 标题 不同数量的#可以完成不同的标题，如下：
一级标题 二级标题 三级标题 2.2 字体 粗体、斜体、粗体和斜体，删除线，需要在文字前后加不同的标记符号。如下：
这个是粗体
这个是斜体
这个是粗体加斜体
~这里想用删除线~~
注：如果想给字体换颜色、字体或者居中显示，需要使用内嵌HTML来实现。
2.3 无序列表 无序列表的使用，在符号-后加空格使用。如下：
无序列表 1 无序列表 2 无序列表 3 如果要控制列表的层级，则需要在符号-前使用空格。如下：

Intro :
Liz (Thora Birch) was born in a slum in the United States and began to suffer from the devastation of the family since she was a child, her parents were drinking and taking drugs, and her mother suffered from schizophrenia.
